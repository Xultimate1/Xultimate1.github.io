  <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/54/122154-050-4DA0F697/Great-Wall-of-China.jpg">
  
  <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across northern China as protection against nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. Later on, many dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty. The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning over 20,000 km in total. </p>

  <h2>Petra</h2>

  <p>Petra, originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu is an historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, by the Nabataeans who settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom, as early as the 4th century BC. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub. The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 AD, many structures were destroyed.</p>

  <p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa, or simply the Tower of Pisa, is the freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide for its nearly four-degree lean, the result of an unstable foundation. The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square, after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry.
The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990, the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees. The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.</p>

  <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and largest of the pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact.

Scientists conclude that the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Egyptian pharaoh Khufu and estimate that it was built in the 26th century BC.

Standing at 138.3 metres, the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. What is seen today is the underlying core structure. The base was measured to be about 230.3 metres square, giving a volume of roughly 2.6 million cubic metres.

  <p>Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England, three kilometres west of Amesbury. It consists of an outer ring of vertical stones, each around 4.1 metres high, 2.1 metres wide, and weighing around 25 tons, topped by connecting horizontal stones. Inside is a ring of smaller bluestones. The whole monument, now ruinous, is orientated towards the sunrise on the summer solstice. The stones are set within earthworks in the middle of the most dense complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England, including several hundred burial mounds.</p>

  <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>
  <img src="https://www.boletomachupicchu.com/gutblt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/machu-picchu-cusco-huayna-picchu-compressor.jpg">
  <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter mountain ridge. It is located in the Machu picchu District within Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers northwest of Cuzco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.
The Incas, in contrast with the Mayans, had no written language, and no European visited the site until the 19th century. There are no written records of the site while it was in use. The names of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their inhabitants are all the product of modern archeologists, on the basis of physical evidence, including tombs at the site.

  <h2>Chichén Itzá</h2>
  <img src="https://cdn.hswstatic.com/gif/chichen-itza.jpg">
  <p>Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people. The site is located in Yucatán State, Mexico.

The site has a multitude of architectural styles, including styles seen in central Mexico. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been because of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but the most popular interpretations suggest that it was was the result of cultural diffusion.

Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.</p>

During ancient times it was known as Cecropia, after the legendary serpent-man, Cecrops, the supposed first Athenian king.

While there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as far back as the fourth millennium BC, it was Pericles in the fifth century BC who coordinated the construction of the buildings whose present remains are the site's most important ones, including the Parthenon, the Propylaea, the Erechtheion and the Temple of Athena Nike.</p>
